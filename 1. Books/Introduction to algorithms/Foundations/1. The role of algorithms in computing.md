## 1.1 Algorithms


#### algorithms: 
- any well-defined computational procedure that takes input values and produces different values
- tool for solving well-specified computational problem
- an algorithm is correct when it produces the right output when data is inputed

#### data structures:
- a data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

#### NP-complete problems:
- NP-complete problems are problems where an efficient solution has not been found to solve these problems

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

Different algorithms that are created to solve the same problem often times differ a lot from each other. there will be drastic different outcomes depending on the amount of input values. Some algorithms are faster when given small amounts of data but lack speed when tasked with a lot of data.
