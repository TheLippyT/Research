- the use of algorithms and data structures
	-	data structures -> arrangement of data in a computer memory. inlcudes arrays, linked lists etc.
	- algorithms -> manipulate the data in these structures
---
- problems to solve:
	- real-world data storage
	- programmer's tools
	- modeling
---
- real-world data storage:
	- how to store data
	- storing copious amounts of data
	- quick inserting, removing, sorting and retrieving of data
---
- programmer's tools:
	- some datastructures are not used by users but by the program itself
---
- real-world modeling:
	- some data structure model real world situations. a graph being one of the most important ones.

| data structure | advantages                                     | disadvantages                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| array          | quick insert, fast access if index is known    | slow search and deletion, fixed size |
| ordered array  | quicker search than unsorted                   | slow insert and deletion, fixed size |
| stack          | provides LIFO access                           | slow access to other items           |
| queue          | provides FIFO access                           | slow access to other items           |
| linked list    | quick insert, quick delete                     | slow search                          |
| binary tree    | quick search, insert, delete(if tree balanced) | deletion algorithm is complex        |
| red-black tree | quick search, insert, delete (always balanced) | complex                              |
| 2-3-4 tree     | quick search, insert, delete(                  | complex                              |
