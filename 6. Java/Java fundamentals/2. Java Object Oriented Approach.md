### General

- always check if they are asking for an exception or compilation failure.
- before the fields of a subclass can be initialized by a constructor, the fields of the superclass have to be initialized first
- when a class has implement multiple interfaces then that class illustrates has support for multipile inheritance of type

### inheritance

- you call `super` if you want to call the overridden method from the super-class
- when something is marked `protected` it will be package private and available to all sub-classes even in other packages. be careful when confronted with only.
- rule of covariant returns: An overriding method (i.e. a sub class's method) is allowed to return a sub-type of the type returned by the overridden method (i.e. super class's method). example when the parent method has a `List` the overridden method can be an `ArrayList` but not higher than list up the hierarchy
- when extending pay attention to the methods in both classes to see if they are not overloaded.
- The RETURN TYPE should be same for overridden and overriding methods.
- when extending classes, the child class implicitly calls super() calling the no-arg constructor from the parent class. pay attention if the parent class has a constructor with arguments in it. implicitly calling the constructor will cause a compilation failure if you don't define the call to super by yourself.
- interfaces allow multiple inheritance
- static methods are also inherited
- Multiple inheritance of state includes ability to inherit instance fields from multiple classes.
- Multiple inheritance of type includes ability to implement multiple interfaces and/or ability to extend from multiple classes.

### interfaces

- when an `interface` extends other interfaces and a class implements that interface. the class must then implement all methods from all interfaces that the interface has and extends
    
- when 2 interfaces throw exceptions and both of the interfaces are implemented in a class then the method can throw the subclass but not the superclass of that exception
    
- if there are 2 interfaces being inherited that have the same method name but with different exceptions being thrown, pay attention if one is a child of the other exception. if so then take the smallest if not then throw no exception
    
- an `interface` can't implement anything
    
- Fields defined in an interface are ALWAYS considered as `public, static, and final`. no value can be assigned to a interface field
    
- methods are considered `public abstract`, methods can also be `private` but they can NEVER be `final` and `protected`
    
- static methods can not be overridden
    
- final methods cannot be overridden
    
- An `interface` can re-declare a default method and provide a different implementation.
    
- You cannot override a non-static method with a static method and vice versa
    
- static and default methods do not require the class that implements the interface to implement the methods
    
- when calling a static method use the interface name and the method
    
    - example
        - ```Java
                                                                                              interface Office  {
                                                                                                  public static String getAddress() {
                                                                                                      return "101 Smart Str";
                                                                                                  }
                                                                                              }
                                                                                              
                                                                                              class HomeOffice implements Office {
                                                                                                  public String getAddress() {
                                                                                                      return "R No 1, Home";
                                                                                                  }
                                                                                              }
                                                                                              
                                                                                              class TestClass {
                                                                                                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                                                                      Office off = new HomeOffice();
                                                                                                      System.out.println(Office.getAddress());
                                                                                                  }
                                                                                              }
            ```
            
- Inheriting ambiguous fields or methods due to implementing multiple interface does not cause any problem by itself (except in the case of default methods) but referring to such fields/methods in an ambiguous way will cause a compile time error.
    
- static methods in interfaces cannot override default methods when extending interfaces.
    
- interface variables can be accessed like this
    
    - ```Java
                    class Sample implements IInt {
                        public static void main(String[] args) {
                            Sample s = new Sample();
                            int j = s.thevalue;
                            int k = IInt.thevalue;
                            int l = thevalue;
                        }
                    }
                    
                    interface IInt {
                        int thevalue = 0;
                    }
        ```
        
- ```Java
              interface AI {    
                  void moo(); 
              } 
              interface FooI extends AI {    
                  @Override void moo();
              }
              The @Override annotation is used to convey the information 
              that this method overrides an inherited method with the 
              same signature. Applying this annotation prevents hard to 
              trace logical errors caused due to spelling mistakes in 
              the method name. It also makes the code easier to understand.
    ```
    

### generics

- be careful with overloading and overriding. when you use a more specific class then it is overloaded. overriding you need the specific class.
- pay attention to the upper and lower-bound wildcards

### inner classes

- initiating static inner classes is done like this: `new Class();`
- inner classes can only have access to variables that are final or effectively final
- when a class implicitly defines a constructor, the access modifier of the constructor will be the same as the constructor the class has.
- ways to access inner classes
    - ```java
                                      //Accessing an non-static inner class from another class
                                                              class Outsider {
                                                                   class Insider {
                                                                  }
                                                              }
                                                              class TestClass {
                                                                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                                      var os = new Outsider();
                                                                      
                                                                      Outsider.Insider in = os.new Insider();
                                                              
                                                                  }
                                                              }
                                                              //Accessing an static inner class from another class
                                                              class Outsider {
                                                                   static class Insider {
                                                                  }
                                                              }
                                                              class TestClass {
                                                                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                              
                                                                      Outsider.Insider in = new Outsider.Insider();
                                                              
                                                                  }
                                                              }
                                                              //Accessing an static inner class from the same class
                                                               class TestClass {
                                                                  static class Inner{ }
                                                                  
                                                                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                                                                      new Inner();
                                                                  }
                                                              }
                                                              //Accessing an static inner class from the same class
                                                               class TestClass {
                                                                  class Inner{ }//can't be used in a static context
                                                              
                                                                  public static void main(String[] args) { }
                                                                  public void secondary(){
                                                                      Inner inner = new Inner();
                                                                  }
                                                              }
        ```
        

### Enums

- An `enum`'s constructor is **private** by default. You **cannot apply public or protected**  to the constructor. private is allowed but is redundant.
- An `enum` is allowed to implement interfaces including Serializable.
- The correct method name is `ordinal()` and not index().
- An `enum` is implicitly final, which means you cannot extend it.
- Since enum maintains exactly one instance of its constants, you cannot clone it. You cannot even override the clone method in an enum because `java.lang.Enum` makes it final
- Compiler provides an `enum` with two public static methods automatically - values() and `valueOf(String)`. The values() method returns an array of its constants and `valueOf()` method tries to match the String argument exactly (i.e. case sensitive) with an enum constant and returns that constant if successful otherwise it throws `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`.
- By default, an enum's toString() prints the enum name but you can override it to print anything you want.
    - It implements java.lang.Comparable (thus, an enum can be added to sorted collections such as SortedSet, TreeSet, and TreeMap). The natural order of the enum values is the order in which they are defined i.e. in the order of their ordinal value.
    - It has a method ordinal(), which returns the index (starting with 0) of that constant i.e. the position of that constant in its enum declaration.
    - It has a method name(), which returns the name of this enum constant, exactly as declared in its enum declaration.
- enums allows you to implement interfaces
- you cannot access non-final static fields from an enum constructor
    - ```Java
                //no good
                enum Pets {    
                    DOG("D"), CAT("C"), FISH("F");    
                    static String prefix = "I am ";    
                    String name;       
                    ets(String s) { name = prefix + s;}    
                    public String getData(){ return name; } 
                }
        ```
        

### abstract

- can't use abstract for fields
- you can only put abstract methods in abstract classes

### static

- static variables do not belong to an instance of a class
- static and instance fields are always defined before everything else. so you can use them even after declaration.
- for static variables there is not this keyword
- First, static statements/blocks are called IN THE ORDER they are defined.
    - Next, instance initializer statements/blocks are called IN THE ORDER they are defined.
- when there are fields that are declared static, when you want to initialize them you do so with a static block. regular assignment only work for non-static fields.
- non-static methods can use static methods and fields but not vice versa.
- only static members are accessible from static methods. there is no this available from static methods

### Overriding

- when overriding a toString that prints a static variable you can call the toString method that prints the variable by calling `this`

### Overloading

- when overloading and the different methods arguments have an inheritance relationship with each other it will use the smallest class first

### Declaration and Instantiation

- everytime a method is called on an object a new object is created
    - example
        - ```Java
                                  LocalDate d1 = LocalDate.now(); // LocalDate object 1 
                                  d1.plusDays(10); // LocalDate object 2, remember object 1 itself remains unchanged 
                                  LocalDate d2 = d1.minusWeeks(1); //LocalDate object 3 
                                  d1 = null; //no object created here 
                                  LocalDate d3 = LocalDate.now().plusYears(3).minusMonths(4); //LocalDate object 4, 5, and 6 
                                  d2.plusWeeks(5); //LocalDate object 7. 
                                  d1 = d2; //no object created here
            ```
