4. Arrays and Collections

### General

- ` List.of/Set.of/Map.of ` returns an unmodifiable list or set. they do not allow null elements. they will throw `NullPointerException`. attempting to to sort a this type of list, set or map will produce a `UnsuportedOperationException`
- The constructors of `ArrayList` and `HashSet` accept a Collection. Since both an `ArrayList` and a `Set` are Collections, there is no problem in creating an `ArrayList` with a `Set` as argument and vice versa.
- Collections are not thread safe because they lack synchronized methods in exchange for being faster. HashTable is thread safe because it has synchronized methods.

### Dequeue

- peek does not remove
- implements a queue
- Since `Queue` is a FIFO structure (First In First Out i.e. add to the end and remove from the front), it has methods `offer(e)`/`add(e)`(for adding an element to the end or tail) and poll()/remove()(for removing an element from the front or head) for this purpose.  Note that offer and add are similar while poll and remove are similar.
- Since `Stack` is a LIFO structure (Last In First Out i.e. add to the front and remove from the front), it provides methods `push(e)` and `pop()` for this purpose, where push adds to the front and pop removes from the front.

### Queue

- Queue is an interface so it cannot be instantiated. `PriorityQueue`is a class that implements Queue.

### ArrayLists and Lists

- pay attention to the return type of the variables.
- when you create an `ArrayList` of type `var` then it will be of type `Object`
- can't pass a null value in `List.of(E e)`
- `replaceAll(UnaryOperator u)` takes in a `UnaryOperator<T>`
- an `ArrayList` allows constant time access to all of its elements
- an `ArrayList` does not store primitives but Objects.
- an `ArrayList` is backed by an array
- Check whether the generic inside the diamond operator have a relationship with the object that it is assigned to.
- Sorting an unmodifiable list will throw `UnsupportedOperationException`
- when calling subList(int a, int b) where a and b have the same value. it will return an empty list
- `ArrayList` extends `java.util.AbstractList`
- `ArrayList` implements `RandomAccess`

### HashMaps and HashSets

- all Hash have a uniques. Maps have keys and sets only keep unique elements
- `Map m = new HashMap();` is untyped, so it will allow anything into m
- `HashMaps` allow `null` values and keys but `ConcurrentHashMaps` does not.
- `values()` method returns a `Collection` of the values of  the Map

### TreeSets

- is a `NavigableSet` and supports `subSet()`
    - - `NavigableSet<E> subSet(E fromElement, boolean fromInclusive, E toElement, boolean toInclusive)`
            \- Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement to toElement. the returned subset is backed by the original set changes that happen to the subset will be reflected into the original. when you create using a range, the element added needs to be within the range otherwise a runtime exception will be thrown
- `addAll()` exists
- TreeSet is an ordered set that keeps its elements in a sorted fashion. When you call the add() method, it immediately compares the element to be added to the existing elements and puts the new element in its appropriate place. Thus, the foremost requirement of a TreeSet is that the elements must either implement Comparable interface (which has the compareTo(Object) method) and they must also be mutually comparable or the TreeSet must be created with by passing a Comparator (which has a compare(Object, Object)) method). For example, you might have two classes \\\\\A\\\ and \\\\\B\\\ both implementing Comparable interface. But if their compareTo() method does not work with both the types, you cannot add both type of elements in the same TreeSet.

### Navigable Map

- methods in `NavigableMap`
    - `Map.Entry<K,V> pollFirstEntry() `
        
        - Removes and returns a key-value mapping associated with the least key in this map, or null if the map is empty.
    - `Map.Entry<K,V> pollLastEntry() `
        
        - Removes and returns a key-value mapping associated with the greatest key in this map, or null if the map is empty.
    - `tailMap(K fromKey, boolean inclusive) `
        
        - Returns a view of the portion of this map whose keys are greater than (or equal to, if inclusive is true) fromKey.

### diamond operators

- when declaring maps or list and you are using diamond operators. both sides need to be the same or the right side can be have only the diamond operator
    - example `Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<>();` and
    - `Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, List<String>>();`
        - `Map<String, List<String>> stateCitiesMap = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>(); ` not allowed because both sides are not of the same type

### generics

- When there is a class with a generic `<T>` and a method also with `<T>` the two are independent of each other
    
    - meaning when you create instance variables and parameters you can't put them equal to each other `this.t = t`
        
    - one way that you can make them equal is when the second `<T>` needs to be a different letter to avoid confusion extends the class `<T>`
        
    - another way you can make them equal is if you don't define a generic in the method
        
        - ```Java
                                              //The cause of confusion in the given code is the presence of <T> in 
                                              //the class declaration as well as in the method declaration.
                                                                                                
                                              //You need to know that the two generic type variables are independent 
                                              //of each other. This means that the <T> in public class 
                                                                                                
                                              //Counter<T> has no relation to the <T> in public  <T> int count(T[] ta, T t).  
                                              //Since the two types are different, you cannot do 
                                                                                                
                                              //this.t = t; inside the method. 
                                                                                                
                                                                                                  
                                              class A {
                                                  public static void main(String[] args) {
                                              
                                                  }
                                              }
                                              }
                                              
                                              public class Counter<T> {  //1     
                                                  T t;
                                              
                                                  public <T> int count(T[] ta, T t) {  //2         
                                                      this.t = t;  //3         
                                                      int count = 0;
                                                      for (T x : ta) {
                                                          count = x == t ? count + 1 : count;//4         
                                                      }
                                                      return count;
                                                  }
                                              }
                                              
                                              class Counter<T> {     
                                                  T t;     
                                                  public  
                                              
                                                  <P extends T> int count(P[] ta, P t) {         
                                                      this.t = t; //this is valid because P extends T, so a P is-a T         
                                                      int count = 0;         
                                                      for (P x : ta) {             
                                                          count =  x == t ? count + 1 : count;         
                                                      }         
                                                      return count;     
                                                  }
                                              }
                                              
                                              //If you want to use the same type that is used for the class, then you should not 
                                              //redeclare it for the method. For example:  
                                              class Counter<T> { //<--- <T> is declared here     
                                                  T t;     
                                              
                                                  public int count(T[] ta, T t) {  //<--- there is no <T> declaration on this line         
                                                      this.t = t; //this is valid now because t and this.t are of same type         
                                                      int count = 0;         
                                                      for (T x : ta) {             
                                                          count =  x == t ? count + 1 : count;         
                                                      }         return count;     
                                                  }
                                              }
            ```
            
    - ```Java
                                          //force S to be a subclass of T
                                          //when T is a Number, S can't be a String
                                          public class Transaction<T, S extends T> {     
                                          
                                              public Transaction(T t, S s) {     
                                              }
                                          }
        ```
        
- Note that to take advantage of automatic type inference during generic class instantiation, you must specify the diamond operator. i.e. You must do new HashMap<>() in this case.
    
- ```java
            //No good
            PlaceHolder<> ph4 = new PlaceHolder<String, String>("a", "b");
    ```
    
- when you have a list with wildcards (lowerbound, upperbound, etc) you will only be able to add to the list that is a lowerbound (super keyword)
    

### Arrays

- `Arrays.binarySearch(array, elementToFind)` searched through an array to find a certain given element
    - if the number is found then the index will be returned
    - if the number is not found then the then a number is returned that is calculated by
- `Arrays.compare(array1, array2)` compares two arrays
    - if both arrays are equal return 0
    - if **array1 > array2** return the difference in the number of elements in both the arrays
    - if **array1 < array2** return -(the difference in the number of elements in both the arrays)
        - if array1 and array2 have a common prefix and array1 number is smaller than array2 number, compare(array1, array2) will return -1.
        - if array1 and array2 have a common prefix and array1 number is larger than array2 number, compare(array1, array2) will return 1.
- `Arrays.mismatch​(int[] a, int[] b)` Finds and returns the index of the first mismatch between two int arrays
    - if no mismatch is found return -1
- Arrays are proper objects and Object references are passed by value (so effectively, it seems as though objects are being passed by reference).
- If you give the elements explicitly you can't give the size.
- == is the same as equals() except when comparing strings and objects

### 2-Dimensional array

- Remember that array indexing starts with 0, therefore, to access element A\[a\]\[b\], A must refer to an array whose length in the first dimension must be at least a+1 and in the second dimension must be at least b+1.
- different ways to create a 2 dimensional array
    - ```Java
                                                                data_type array_name[][];   (OR)     data_type[][] array_name;
                                                                //regular
                                                                int[][] arr1 = { { 1, 2, 3 }, { 4, 5, 6 } };
                                                                //1
                                                                int[][] arr = new int[][3];
                                                                int[][] arr = new int[2][];
                                                                //2
                                                                int[][] scores = new int[2][2];
                                                                //3
                                                                 int[][] marks = new int[rows][columns];
                                                                 
                                                                        // initializing the array elements using for loop
                                                                        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
                                                                            for (int j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
                                                                                marks[i][j] = i + j;
                                                                            }
                                                                        }
                                                                //4
                                                                int jagged[][] = new int[2][];
                                                                 jagged[0] = new int[2];
                                                                 jagged[1] = new int[4];
        ```
        

### Streams

### Comparable and Comparator

- Comparable
    - A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. The class itself **MUST** implements the `java.lang.Comparable` interface to compare its instances.
    - The comparable interface has a method `compareTo(Object a )`
    - Collection.sort(List) method can be used to sort the collection of Comparable type objects.
    - Comparable provides single sorting sequence.
    - `sorted()` is never empty otherwise it will throw a `ClassCastException`. check if the classes implement `Comparable`
- Comparator
    - Comparator is external to the element type we are comparing. It’s a separate class. We create multiple separate classes (that implement Comparator) to compare by different members. Collections class has a second sort() method and it takes Comparator. The sort() method invokes the compare() to sort objects. belongs to java.util.package
        
    - Collection.sort(List, Comparator) method can be used to sort the collection of Comparator type objects.
        
    - The comparator provides a multiple sorting sequence.
        

### Collections

- calling Collections.sort(array,null) will make the natural sorting order
