1. Working With Java Data Types

### Data

- any number prefixed with a 0 is considered an octal

### Operators

| Operator Type | Category             | Precedence                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Unary         | postfix              | expr++ expr--                                 |
| Unary         | prefix               | ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !                 |
| Arithmetic    | multiplicative       | \* / %                                        |
| Arithmetic    | additive             | \+ -                                          |
| Shift         | shift                | &lt;< &gt;\> >>>                              |
| Relational    | comparison           | &lt; \&gt; ; &lt;= &gt;= instanceof           |
| Relational    | equality             | == !=                                         |
| Bitwise       | bitwise AND          | &                                             |
| Bitwise       | bitwise exclusive OR | ^                                             |
| Bitwise       | bitwise inclusive OR | \|                                            |
| Logical       | logical AND          | &&                                            |
| Logical       | logical OR           | \|                                            |
| Ternary       | ternary              | ? :                                           |
| Assignment    | assignment           | = += -= *= /= %= &= ^= \|= &lt;<= &gt;>= >>>= |

- `%` floating points as well as integral types
- Arithmetic operators have the same level precedence
- `!`, `&&` and `||` operate only on `boolean`.
- `~` Operates only on integral types
- `a += (a =4)` is same as `a = a + (a=4)`.
    - if a declaration of a has been made you need to use that value before the right side will be evaulated
- when using bit-wise ( |  or &) operators with `char` values. it will produce a result by adding those 2 values
- All compound assignment operators internally do an explicit cast. so you can have a smaller integral type be made from larger.
- & can have `integral` as well as `boolean` operands

### data types

- integral types means `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, and `char`, and floating point are `float` and `double`
    
- Boolean values that are allowed:
    
    - Expressions example: `10>11`;
    - `true` or `false` or any of these formats: `true | false` or the short circuit `true || false`
- whenever both the operands of a mathematical operator (such as `/` and `*`) are integral types except `long`
    
    result will be `integer`. when calculating and you get a fraction round it down.
    
- `int` values can be assigned to `long`, `float` or `double`
    
- floats can be written without an `f` only when used with NON-decimal numbers
    
- Chaining to use a value of a variable at the time of declaration is not allowed
    
    - example
        - `int a = b = c = 100;`
- when you do additions with data of integral types you convert it to `int`. if there is a `float` convert to `double`. check for divisions that turn into a `double`
    
- when you want to convert a larger datatype to a smaller one then explicit casting is required
    
- float and double: you can parse `"-Infinity"` and `"+infinity"`
    
- dividing with a 0.0f or 0.0 you will get infinity or negative infinity depending on the first number

### var

- `var` is not a keyword so you can use it as a name for a field or method
- `var` is not allowed as an instance variable. can only be inside a method body
- using `var` to create an `Collection` without specifying which type will create an `Collection` of type `Object`
- `var` can't be used in a compound declaration.
- `var` is not allowed of type array( `var[]` is not allowed). initialize an array with var: `var a = new int[] {};`
- `var` can't be a return type
- `var` can't be a method parameter

### Object

- an `Object` array can have every single datatype
- when assigning `null` to an object and you try to print it you will get `null` as a result
- when trying to use a null for a method then that method will throw a `NulPointerException`
- when you get an array and a visual representation of the array the first part of the array is the rows and the second number are the columns `int[][] matrix = new int[rows][columns]`

### String

- `String` cannot be extended because `String` is a final class. `StringBuilder` and `StringBuffer` are also `final` classes
- `isBlank()` returns `true` if the string is empty or contains only white space code points, otherwise `false`.
- when a `String = null`, the beginning string of this object when trying to add different strings will be `"null"` . pay close attention to when a string is assigned to null.
- `concat` does not change the string but rather creates a new object.

### StringBuilder

- `append()` adds the string to the END of the line
- `append`(3 params) takes in a string and the 2 other params are the portion of the string that needs to be appended
- `substring(int indexIncluded, int indexExcluded)`
- `replace(index1, index2, String)` will take part of the string starting from index1 which is included and ending at index2 which is excluded(ended in index2 - 1).
- setting a stringbuilder capacity is done like this `Stringbuilder s = new StringBuilder(int capacity)` and `s.ensureCapacity(100)`

### local variables

- local variables must be initialized;
