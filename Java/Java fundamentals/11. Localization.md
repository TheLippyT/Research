11. Localization

### Localization

- `df.format(Date, Locale)` is wrong. There is no such method in `DateFormat`.
- In order for a program to load a resource bundle, the resource bundle properties file must be in the CLASSPATH.
- check hwo the Locale is defined if only the language is given or the country as well. check the available resourcebundles and their names. the base resource bundle and the child resource bundle will be loaded. child values will always override the values in the parent classes
- `DateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPatterm(String s, Locale l)`

### DateTime Formatter

- There is no setLocale method in DateTimeFormatter. when creating the formatter the local needs to be passed as a parameter valuek
    
    - ```Java
              Local loc = new Locale();
              DateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd MMM yyyy", loc);
              //you can also pass only the string format without a locale
              //in doing so you will use the default locale
              DateTimeFormatter df = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("dd MMM yyyy");
        ```
        
- what to know for the exam
    
    - m(minutes), M(month), d(day of month), D(day of year), e(localized day of week), y(year of era), s(second of minute), S(fraction of second), h(clock hour of AM and PM), H(hour of day), and z(time zone name).
        
        - to display the month you can use the following
            - ```Java
                    //Example
                      M => 2, 12 
                      MM => 02, 12 
                      MMM => févr., déc. 
                      MMMM => février, décembre
                ```
                
- DateFormat cannot be instantiated because it is an abstract class. You must use DateFormat.getDateInstance(...) methods. Also, DateFormat's format method takes java.util.Date and not LocalDate.
