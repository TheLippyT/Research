9. JDBC

### JDBC

- in JDBC 4.0 class driver is not needed
    
- parameters in a query starts with 1
    
    - ```Java
                  String qr = "insert into USERINFO values( ?, ?, ?)";
                  //3 query parameters
        ```
        
- A `CallableStatement` is easier to build and call from JDBC code than a `PreparedStatement`.
    
- when `con.setAutoCommit(false);` is available then you have to manually commit the query with `close()`
    
- Statement's enquoteLiteral method returns a String enclosed in single quotes. Any occurrence of a single quote within the string will be replaced by two single quotes. This prevents SQL injection attacks.
    
- The numbering of columns in a ResultSet starts with 1. Therefore, rs.getString(0) will cause an SQLException.
    
- Once a Connection object is closed, you cannot access any of the subsequent objects such as Statement and ResultSet that are retrieved from that Connection.
    
- BLOB and CLOB datatypes depend on the database wether they support it or not

### PreparedStatements

- setNull(param1 , param2) second parameter expects one of the values in java.sql.Types.
- Types.STRING and JDBCType.STRING does not exist
- unboxing a null value will throw a NullPointerException
- protect against SQL injection attacks
