Chapter 8: Class Design

### Understanding Inheritance

- when a child class inherits from a parent class, all public and protected members will be available to the child class. members with a defaul(package private) modifier) will only be available to the child class if it is in the same package as the parent class.

- when inheriting: when classes are in the same package you do not need an import statement. when in different packages an import statement is required.
